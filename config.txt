## Install


### Spyder installation
- Load Anaconda and download SPYDER \n


### Environnement for streamlit installation
- With your Anaconda Shell (CMD.EXE for windows users) or cmd shell for macOS users, go where the environment.yml is located in your computer with the command "cd". \n
Example : cd Desktop/emlyon/streamlit (Copy the path directly)
Warning : if your folders contains spaces, use double quotes (Documents/"em lyon"/"Streamlit Session"/Session4)
- When you are at the right location, please enter this command in the shell :
conda env create -f environment.yml -n StreamlitEnv
- The kernel starts to process : It takes time (around 10-20 minutes). Let it open.
- When it's over, enter the command : conda activate StreamlitEnv. 
Each time you are going to use Streamlit, you must load this environnement to process the app. 
You can load this environnement with the previous command or activate it before lauching spyder directly in this code.
This environment already contains plotly, streamlit and pandas.
- To see if it's work, type in the kernel/cmd : streamlit hello. To close the app, go to your shell again and use Alt + C (option + C)


Each time, you will need to load this environment in jupyter notebook and spyder. To do so, go in anaconda > environnmenents and 
click on Streamlit env. Then you can open Spyder and Jupyter notebook.
